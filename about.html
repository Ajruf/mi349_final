            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Growing up with my family I was exposed to many different types of music. I have always had an interest in music in general, as I can play various instruments as well. One of my life goals is to make an impact on the music industry, and with this innovation I believe there is a chance for that. When it comes to playing music I have felt there was always room for improvement. Although there are many ways to adjust music settings in terms of production, there are not many applications that exist for consumer use. After discovering the utility of equalizers, incorporating them in speakers through programming became the solution for improvement. </p>
