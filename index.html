            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>Sound Adapting Speakers are a brand-new take on speakers. Our various prototypes include an implemented program that scans audio files and adjusts equalizer settings for the best listening experience. The algorithms not only pick up music, but other types of audios such as movie dialogue, sound effects, home videos, etc. We plan to further our technology in the form of our own premium speakers and also have a external application that provides a cheaper method of accessing our software. </p>

            <h3>Product Goals</h3>
            <p>As one may know there are many different types of speakers ranging in utility and quality today. Many companies advertise sound quality, product durability and other important aspects of their speakers. Our speakers are specialized to give customers the perfect listening experience. Speaker companies fail to address the significance of audio adjustment, so thatâ€™s where our speakers fill that issue. Alongside our commitment to premium hardware and speaker sound, our products focus on the never-utilized audio equalizer by making it an autonomously adjusting program. Many are unaware of the option of manually adjusting equalizers as many applications make it difficult to find the setting. Our goal is to enhance users listening experience in a unique way and create a standard for all speakers.</p>

            <p>We designed our prototypes with intentions of being compact, but big enough for our customers to hear the vast differences in audio settings for every song.</p>
